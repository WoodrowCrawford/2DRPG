# 2DRPG
Welcome! You upset your math teacher by saying that math is lame, so now you have upset the shape Gods.
Now, a bunch of square minions have decided to gang up on you! It's time to square up and take them all out! How long will you last?
Oh, and bullets can fall back down and hurt you because of physics. Math is really not on your side.


# Controls
Use the mouse to move the character and press the left mouse button to shoot! 

# Tips
Bullets can fall back down and you only have one life. There are no restarts in life.
That green bar is not a sheild. It is false hope.
